# Trusty ToDo

# Setup
1. Clone the git repo in your local machine and start a terminal in the base folder. Run the following:
```
npm install npm-run-all
```
2. Once dependency is installed run the following command to install all dependencies in both server and client.
```
npm run iall

```
3. In order to run both server and client simultaneously:
```
npm run all

```
4. Both the front-end and the back-end should be running at this point, and you should be directed to your localhost 
   on port 3000.
